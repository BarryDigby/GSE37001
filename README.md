This repository contains the results of Differential Gene, Transcript, Exon and Intron usage in siRNA directed `METTL3` knockdown & control HepG2 cells (n=2) in an attempt to faithfully reproduce the RNA-Seq analysis performed in the Nature paper [Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11112).

Methods and results are detailed below, with comments describing missing information that would have aided the analysis from a reviewers perpective. The results from this repository are to be used in conjunction with a M6A analysis of HepG2 cells, to interrogate correlations between M6A peaks and differential gene/transcript/exon/intron usage.
